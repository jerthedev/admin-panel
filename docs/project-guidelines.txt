The Jira project for JTD-AdminPanel is JTDAP.
The Confluence space is JTDAP.

You are working on a Laravel package, not a full Laravel application.  Keep that in mind, while keeping everything self-contained within the package.

Important: Ticket process should be:
1. Read the entire ticket and current project structure.  Follow all links in the ticket description and analyze that as part of the acceptance criteria.  Summarize the details here in chat
2. Write a comment on the task with the summary and assign the task for me, change the status to In Progress
3. Complete the task; for items already completed ensure test coverage.
4. Review the ticket description and the current code one more time.  Ensure all acceptance criteria is met.  If anything is missing, stop and summarize for me.
5. Add a comment to the task about what was finished and change the task status to In Review

Everything should be 100% compatible with Nova's documentation.  In some cases, there are features we are expanding.
Expanded features should still be compatible with Nova's documentation, but with the additional APIs and features.

Please ensure tests are complete and pass 100% for the each task:
1. PHP Class Unit Test (tests/Unit/<feature>/)
 - Run code coverage analysis and ensure 100% coverage
2. Vue component test (tests/components/<feature>/)
3. PHP Laravel Integration Test (in tests/Integration/<feature>/)
4. Vue component integration test (in tests/Integration/<feature>/components/)
5. PHP e2e test (in tests/e2e/<feature>/)
6. Vue component playwright tests (in tests/e2e/<feature>/components)
 - Do not run the Playwright tests in this environment, simply ensure the tests are written and will pass.

Where <feature> could be Fields, Filters, Actions, etc.

After changing PHP files, run the command vendor/bin/pint <filename> to allow Laravel Pint to reformat and clean up the file
